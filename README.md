# God Hand's Pinball game
This is a recreation of the game "Pinball" by Nintendo. Made by God Hand Team for the CITM Physics II course.

## Features (and differences from the original)
Most of the features from the original game are included. However:
  - Layout is different (The whole board is visible & UI displays are changed)
  - Some of the animations are different (i.e. seal balls)
  - Some bonuses work a bit differently than the original (i.e. eggs)
  - Not all the combos are included (i.e. penguins)
  - There is no bonus screen. When entering the hole that would lead to such, ball gets teleported to the top one instead.
